In the days when I got no re-
What it look like man?

My niggas now a days we ain't really tryna play no games
We ain't got no time to play no games with you
My niggas now a days we ain't really tryna play no games
We ain't got no time to play no games with you
So hear me loud and clear

Finna do all the things they keep sayin' you can't
Then do it times two
Just to remind fools that the first time wasn't a lucky mistake
Put pieces of my soul into all I create
Plant crops to be watered that I take to the bank
So a hundred years after I'm gone my people super straight
Tryna own some property
It's a must, I attain some
They crush everything we see that bring the city its flavor
Mom-and-pop businesses
Spots people livin' in for years
Raise they families in
Meet the bulldozer, wrecking ball then the damage begins
Treat these words like mumble rap patterns ya hear
Then I'm just another nigga on a rhythm, on a tangent again
It's ya favorite Los Angeles kid
Strangers say the cities divided by the tans of our skin
Only located in places with our own races
But I never seen it that way since I'm everywhere
Gentrification gets you replaced with what they say
Can make papers stack under they feet like Pit-Fighter
Somebody sittin' back with a cigar and a Bic lighter
(In the days when I got no re-)
But I know muthafuckas sick and tired
(Uh, yeah crank it up)

My niggas now a days we ain't really tryna play no games
We ain't got no time to play no games with you (Real spit)
My niggas now a days we ain't really tryna play no games
We ain't got no time to play no games with you
So hear me loud and clear

My peoples is holding me down (No hesitation)
I got my head up facing the clouds (No hesitation)
I grab the mic, controlling the crowd (No hesitation)
I live my dreams the only way I know how
Without hesitation
I said my peoples is holding me down (No hesitation)
I got my head up facing the clouds (No hesitation)
I grab the mic, controlling the crowd (No hesitation)
I live my dreams the only way I know how
Without hesitation

This nigga think he woke!

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na na-na
Yo yo, crack that champagne for me man
Pour me some, lemme get this shit right here

No matter how tough right now things seem to be
When you wait patiently
Your time will come you'll see
So keep your head high up nigga, uh
No matter how tough right now things seem to be
When you wait patiently
Your time will come you'll see
So keep your head high baby girl, uh
No matter how tough right now things seem to be
When you wait patiently
Your time will come you'll see
So keep your head high up, uh

They place they beds then I took the challenge
If they make they beds they should be dressed up in pajamas
If you havin' doubts then just for now you should be silent
'Cause if I say I'm finna take a dare, I'mma keep my fuckin' promise
Turned problems into a solution
Just gotta think about it, then decide to take the footsteps
Try to clear my mind of all the thoughts I feel is useless
Opinions stoppin' me from gettin' mine?
You must be fuckin' stupid
Make lucrative opportunities from new ideas
Enjoy the fruits of my labor then do the shit again
Always keep it one-hundred with family and friends
I'm comfortable in my skin 'cause I know who I am, so

No matter how tough right now things seem to be
When you wait patiently
Your time will come you'll see
So keep your head high up, uh
No matter how tough right now it seems to be
When you wait patiently
Your time will come
