My grandpa fought in World War Two
He was such a noble dude
I can't even finish school
Missed my mom, and left too soon
His dad was a fireman
Who fought fires so violent
I think I bored my therapist
While playing him my violin

(Oh my God) that's so insane
(Oh my God) that's such a shame
Next to them, my sh- don't feel so grand
But I can't help myself from feeling bad (bad)
I kinda feel like two things can be sad
(I kinda feel like two things can be sad)

The world's smallest violin (violin)
Really needs an audience (really needs an)
So if I do not find somebody soon (No-oh-oh)
I'll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
Just let me play my violin for you, you
